The SAMMI DLL relates to the following SAMMI functions:
- Minimizing to Tray
- Command Line Command
- Get LAN IP
- Auto-boot after a restart
- Bubble notifications 

If the above functions are not working as expected, it is most likely that your machine is missing some dependencies.\
Users might be missing the following dependencies on fresh Windows 10: 
- VCRUNTIME140_1.dll
- VCRUNTIME140.dll
- MSVCP140.dll

This problem can be fixed by installing the Visual C++ Redistributable from [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
