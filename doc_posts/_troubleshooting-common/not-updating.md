Occasionally, when updating from earlier versions of SAMMI, you may encounter an issue where the SAMMI Updater fails to download correctly.  

If this happens, you can manually download the SAMMI Updater from the [SAMMI Github repository](https://github.com/SAMMISolutions/SAMMI-Official/raw/main/download/SAMMI%20Updater.zip).  

Once downloaded, move the complete SAMMI Updater folder into the directory where SAMMI is installed, and then launch SAMMI Updater.exe to perform the update. The steps for doing so are illustrated in the video provided below.
