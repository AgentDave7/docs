title: Error Messages on Crash

When SAMMI crashes, you will receive a pop up with details of which button and command caused it to crash. In most cases, the pop up will also provide details on why it crashed. This makes it easy for you to pinpoint what went wrong in your button in order for you to fix it.

For non-button errors, you will be asked if you want to send the error message directly to the devs on discord, and if you want to include a short message - please use this to describe what happened leading up to the crash. This does not require you to have a discord account, nor be in the server.

All your error messages are automatically saved in your SAMMI folder, in chronological order, in the `error_log.txt` file.

It is crucial you copy or screenshot the error messages when asking for help in the discord server.
