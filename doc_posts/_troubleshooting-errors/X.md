When LioranBoard crashes, you will receive a pop up with details of which button and command caused it to crash. In most cases, the pop up will also provide details on why it crashed. This makes it easy for you to pinpoint what went wrong in your button in order for you to fix it.

All your error messages are automatically saved in your LioranBoard 2 folder, in chronological order, in the `error_log.txt` file.

It is crucial you copy or screenshot the error messages when asking for help in the discord server.
