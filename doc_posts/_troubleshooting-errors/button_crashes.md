title: Button Command Crashes   
num: 1
---

The error will be called `Button Command Error` and these crashes are in 99% of cases user errors.    

Your buttons may have incorrect syntax or you just told SAMMI to do something it really didn't like, such as trying to execute a math on a string or adding a string and number together.   

Debugging these crashes is rather easy, since the error message tells you exactly which button ID, command and line the crash occured in.
