When SAMMI crashes, you will receive a pop up with the error details.  

There are 2 different types of crashes in SAMMI, **button errors** and **non button errors**. 

All your error messages are automatically saved in your SAMMI folder, in chronological order, in the `error_log.txt` file.

{% include alert.html text="It is crucial you copy or screenshot the error message when asking for help in the Discord server." type="warning" %} 

SAMMI will automatically launch again after a crash. You can disable this option in Settings.
