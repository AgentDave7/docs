Returns a [JSON string](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) of the whole object.\
You can use this command together with File: Save String command to save the whole object into a file. Once loading it back from the file, you can use Parse Array/Object command to turn the JSON string back into the original object.   

Stringifies a whole button if you leave the `Object Name` box empty or set it to `local` for the current button, or put in the button ID you wish to stringify.
