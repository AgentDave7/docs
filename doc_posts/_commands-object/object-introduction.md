Object is a container for named values called properties.
The variables that an object holds can be of any data type and these variables can be read from and written to after the initial object creation, and you can also add more variables to an object after it has been created.

Example of an (stringified) object called `person`: 

```json
{
	"firstName": "John",
	"lastName": "Doe",
	"age": 50,
	"eyeColor": "blue"
};
```
