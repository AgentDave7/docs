SAMMI is a closed source app made in GameMaker Studio 2 which has become one of the most popular and customizable OBS Stream Decks. The app is based on a build of LioranBoard 2, developed by Lioran Waters. 

The Dev Team for LioranBoard 2 started building upon the original LioranBoard 2 code in June 2022, adding features and bug fixes that had been requested from the LioranBoard 2 for a long time. 

In August 2022, it was rebranded and renamed to SAMMI. The team is continuing the upkeep and development of the software, including adding more features and keeping up to date with changes in the streamerverse.
