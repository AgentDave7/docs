#### Auto Update SAMMI
SAMMI comes with an auto-updater that allows you to update or verify SAMMI Core, SAMMI Deck and Bridge. While SAMMI is running, right-click on the SAMMI icon in your system tray and select `Check for Updates`. 

If there are updates available, you will be able to update or verify the SAMMI components to make sure you are on the latest version.

#### Back up your data
SAMMI is a self contained app in the SAMMI folder, you do not go through the process of installing it like with other apps.
This means you can freely copy the whole SAMMI folder to another computer and it will work just the same!

All your current decks are saved as `json/decks_data.json` file. SAMMI automatically creates a backup file every time you save your deck.
