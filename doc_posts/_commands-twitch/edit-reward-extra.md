Updates a Custom Reward created on your channel, allowing you to change additional settings that are not accessible from the regular [Edit Reward](twitch#editreward) command.\
This means that the reward must show that it is 'Owned' by LioranBoard in the Twitch Connections > Edit Channel Points window.

Selecting 'Dupe' in the Edit Channel Points window allows you to duplicate your existing Twitch-created Channel Point Rewards so that they are created and owned by LioranBoard. Once you have duplicated the rewards you want, go back into Twitch and delete your Twitch-created rewards.

To do.
